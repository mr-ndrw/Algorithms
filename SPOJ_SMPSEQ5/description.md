#SMPSEQ5 - Fun with Sequences (Act 3)

You are given a sequence of n integers S = s1, s2, ..., sn and a sequence of m integers Q = q1, q2, ..., qm. Please, print in the ascending order all such i, that si = qi, i<=n, i<=m.

##Input data specification

In the first line you are given one integer 2<=n<=100, and in the following line n integers: 
-100 <= si <= 100, si <= si+1.

In the third line you are given one integer 2<=m<=100, and in the following line m integers: 
-100 <= qi <= 100, qi <= qi+1.

##Output data specification

The sequence of requested integers separated by spaces.

##Example


>>###Input:

>>5

>>-2 -2 -1 1 4 

>>6

>>-3 -2 -1 1 2 3
